 - All the if/else statements on emac3/mac2mac/marvell phy would be nice to
   clean up. the mac2mac/marvell phy stuff are clearly board properties so
   a dt-binding would be appropriate, the emac3 general stuff can be hooked
   into the compatible matching
 - pm_runtime stuff needs to go away
 - add emac0
	- Figure out why phy at 0x8 is reporting phy_id of 0 instead of Marvell's value
 - overhaul dwmac4 changes again
	- sneak context into callbacks, sneak in address changes for MTL/DMA
	  from dwmac-qcom-ethqos
 - warnings on build about unused priv var
