 - mac2mac_88Q5072 CLK_SHIFT_PHASE_EN disable stuff looks particularly yuck
 - pm_runtime stuff
 - add emac0
 - overhaul dwmac4 changes again
 - safety_feat_cfg
    - original behavior (see jira) was to enable all features
      safety_feat_cfg added to allow a subset to be enabled but was not
      added to all platforms
    - either return to original behavior if !safety_feat_cfg, or keep
      behavior or "supported in hardware but not in software"
 - warnings on build about unused priv var
